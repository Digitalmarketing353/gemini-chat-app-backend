# Docker (sometimes Dockerfile itself is gitignored if built by CI from a template,
# but for deploying to Railway where it reads from repo, you DO want to commit Dockerfile)
# So, DO NOT add Dockerfile to .gitignore here.

# Sequelize CLI generated files (if you want to manage them differently, usually committed)
# config/config.json # Usually committed, but sensitive parts should use env vars
# models/index.js # If generated by CLI and you adapted it, commit your version

# Migration and Seeder files should BE COMMITTED
# So, DO NOT add migrations/ or seeders/ to .gitignore
